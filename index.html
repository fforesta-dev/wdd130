            <p>My name is Francesco Foresta, and I'm a professional translator and Senior Learning & Development Coordinator. I've been working in the translation industry since 2008, specializing in marketing, IT, and life sciences from English and French into Italian. Since 2022, I've also been supporting global training programs for over 11,000 employees. I'm originally from Terni, Italy, and currently live in Narni. I'm now pursuing a degree in Software Development to expand my technical skills, and I'm especially excited to deepen my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and web technologies.</p>
